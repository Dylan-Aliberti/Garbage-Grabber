# Garbage-Grabber
This repository contains all code from the Garbage Grabber project. The garbage grabber is a prototype for a smart garbage bin that can automatically separate waste. This bin uses a spectrograph and a capacitive sensor, coupled with machine learning, to determine what category of waste is in it. This project was done by Dylan Aliberti, Brammert Habing, Tim Mulder, and Jonathan Pilgram, as an intership at Cyclus N.V. For more information, please refer to our report in the link below.

The code in the Arduino folder is a modified version of the code from this repository: https://github.com/Illutron/AdvancedTouchSensing .
